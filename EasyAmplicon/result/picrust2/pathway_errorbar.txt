It consists of the light dependent part (light reaction) and the light independent part (dark reaction, carbon fixation). The light reaction takes place in thylakoid, a membrane-bound compartment inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The light energy is used by photosystems I and II to generate proton motive force and reducing power (NADPH or NADH). The proton motive force is used by ATP synthase to generate ATP, essentially in the same way as the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The supplies of ATP and NAD(P)H are then used to fix carbon dioxide.	Metabolism; Energy metabolism	Photosynthesis

The parasite life cycle involves hematophagous reduviid bugs as vectors. Once parasites enter the host body, they invade diverse host cells including cardiomyocytes. Establishment of infection depends on various parasite molecules such as cruzipain, oligopeptidase B, and trans-sialidase that activate Ca2+ signaling. Internalized parasites escape from the parasitophorous vacuole using secreted pore-forming TcTOX molecule and replicate in the cytosol. Multiplied parasites eventually lyse infected host cells and are released in the circulation. During these events, the parasites manipulate host innate immunity and elicit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. T lymphocyte responses are also disturbed.	Human Diseases; Infectious disease: parasitic	Chagas disease

In Arabidopsis the circadian oscillator at the core of this system is composed of the interlocked feedback loop formed by the major transcriptional factors CCA1 (circadian clock associated), LHY (late elongated hypocotyl) and TOC1 (timing of cab), a pseudo response regulator (PRR). The morning-expressed CCA1/LHY Myb transcription factors suppress TOC1 expression by binding to its promoter. Moreover, CCA1/LHY activates the expression of PRR7/9 in the morning and then PRR7/9 repress the transcription of CCA1/LHY during the rest of the day. By contrast, the evening-expressed TOC1 activates the expression of CCA1/LHY.	Organismal Systems; Environmental adaptation	Circadian rhythm - plant

They are derive from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and can be cyclized to produce various skeletal structures. Sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis begins with the loss of diphosphate from FPP under the action of sesquiterpene synthesis enzymes, generating an allylic cation that is highly susceptible to intramolecular attacks. Cyclization of the farnesyl cation may take place onto either of the remaining double bonds with the result that 6-, 10-, or 11-membered rings may be formed. Many sesquiterpenoids have been isolated from plants, fungi, marine organisms, and Streptomyces species. This map shows a few examples of acyclic and cyclic sesquiterpenoids.

Aldosterone plays a major role in sodium and potassium metabolism by binding to epithelial mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the renal collecting duct cells localized in the distal nephron, promoting sodium resorption and potassium excretion. Aldosterone enters a target cell and binds MR, which translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription. Activation of MR leads to increased expression of Sgk-1, which phosphorylates Nedd4-2, an ubiquitin-ligase which targets ENAC to proteosomal degradation. Phosphorylated Nedd4-2 dissociates from ENAC, increasing its apical membrane abundance. Activation of MR also leads to increased expression of Na+/K+-ATPase, thus causing a net increase in sodium uptake from the renal filtrate. The specificity of MR for aldosterone is provided by 11beta-HSD2 by the rapid conversion of cortisol to cortisone in renal cortical collecting duct cells. Recently, besides genomic effects mediated by activated MR, rapid aldosterone actions that are independent of translation and transcription have been documented.

The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.

ko03050	LinDA	KO	WT	0.0377308222519925	none	0.0377308222519925	Proteasome	The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer. PA28 gamma has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. PA200 has been identified as a large nuclear protein that stimulates proteasomal hydrolysis of peptides.

The parasites are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier and cause neurological damage by inducing cytokines like TNF alpha, IFN gamma, and IL1. These cytokines and other metabolites such as nitric oxide and somnogenic prostaglandin D2 disturb circadian rhythms in patients with African trypanosomiasis.

ko04614	LinDA	KO	WT	0.00438905578583747	none	0.00438905578583747	Renin-angiotensin system	The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a peptidergic system with endocrine characteristics regarding to the regulation of the blood pressure and hydro-electrolytic balance. In the classical RAS, the enzyme renin cleaves its substrate angiotensinogen (Agt) forming the decapeptide angiotensin I that is in turn cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce the angiotensin II (Ang II), a key player of this system. Ang II activates its AT1 receptor (AT1R), the principal receptor that mediates the majority of the known actions of Ang II in the kidney, including vasoconstriction, renal sodium (Na+) reabsorption, and aldosterone secretion, increasing blood pressure and contributing to the development of hypertension. In addition to (ACE)/Ang II/AT1R and AT2R axis, other signaling pathways in the RAS, such as ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/Mas and Ang IV/IRAP, and other active peptide of the RAS, with physiological relevance as Ang III, Ang A and alamandine, are now widely recognized.

The organism has several ways to divert the effectiveness of the immune system: secreting immune modulating proteins that inhibit complement activation and neutrophil chemotaxis or lysis, modulating the sensitivity to cationic antimicrobial peptides (such as defensin) by increasing the positive net charge of its cytoplasmic membrane, and expression of superantigens that prevent development of a normal immune response or cause an emetic response when ingested.

ko05220	LinDA	KO	WT	0.00265366113258696	none	0.00265366113258696	Chronic myeloid leukemia	Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.	Human Diseases; Cancer: specific types	Chronic myeloid leukemia

Non-self RNA appearing in a cell as a result of intracellular viral replication is recognized by a family of cytosolic RNA helicases termed RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). The RLR proteins include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 and are expressed in both immune and nonimmune cells. Upon recognition of viral nucleic acids, RLRs recruit specific intracellular adaptor proteins to initiate signaling pathways that lead to the synthesis of type I interferon and other inflammatory cytokines, which are important for eliminating viruses.

ko04972	LinDA	KO	WT	0.00711952872602581	none	0.00711952872602581	Pancreatic secretion	The pancreas performs both exocrine and endocrine functions. The exocrine pancreas consists of two parts, the acinar and duct cells. The primary functions of pancreatic acinar cells are to synthesize and secrete digestive enzymes. Stimulation of the cell by secretagogues such as acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin (CCK) causes the generation of an intracellular Ca2+ signal. This signal, in turn, triggers the fusion of the zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane, leading to the polarised secretion of the enzymes. The major task of pancreatic duct cells is the secretion of fluid and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), which neutralize the acidity of gastric contents that enter the duodenum. An increase in intracellular cAMP by secretin is one of the major signals of pancreatic HCO3- secretion. Activation of the CFTR Cl- channel and the CFTR-dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities is responsible for cAMP-induced HCO3- secretion.	Organismal Systems; Digestive system	Pancreatic secretion
ko05410	LinDA	KO	WT	0.00954836992577177	none	0.00954836992577177	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myfibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.

ko04310	LinDA	KO	WT	0.00174752639576754	none	0.00174752639576754	Wnt signaling pathway	Wnt proteins are secreted morphogens that are required for basic developmental processes, such as cell-fate specification, progenitor-cell proliferation and the control of asymmetric cell division, in many different species and organs. There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.

Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.	Cellular Processes; Transport and catabolism	Endocytosis
