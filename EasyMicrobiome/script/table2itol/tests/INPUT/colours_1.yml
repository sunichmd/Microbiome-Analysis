# Example file for user-defined colour vectors. The YAML format has to be used.
# Names of the colour vectors are optional but increase readability. Not all
# colour vectors need to be defined, only those that should replace default
# colour vectors. An attempt is made to standardize the input colours, yielding
# hexadecimal codes (such as the ones listed below). You could use readable
# names such as 'blue', 'green' etc. instead; they just need to be understood
# by R.
